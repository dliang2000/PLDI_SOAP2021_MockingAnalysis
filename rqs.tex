\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:rqs}

We now discuss our research questions and the motivation behind them. 

{\bf RQ1} How frequent is mock usage?

{\bf RQ2} To what extent does static analysis on test suites become imprecise due to mocks?

Both our research questions aim to show the importance of differentiating invocations on mock objects from real invocations.
