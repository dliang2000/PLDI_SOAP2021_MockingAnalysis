	When writing unit tests for Java artifacts with multiple dependencies, developers often introduce mock objects to mimic the dependencies' behaviour. Most Java static analysis frameworks, however, does not provide a tool to identify mock objects created in the unit test cases. The lack of mock object detection could misinterpret the test-to-code traceability, meaning the static analysis framework would mistakenly treat the method invoked by mock objects as the behaviour being tested in unit test cases. 
	
	In this paper, we introduce MockDetector, a technique to identify mock objects created within unit test cases. The tool is able to detect the common Java mocking libraries' API creating mock objects in a recursive manner. The collection of mock objects from the tool could later help static analysis tools identifying focal methods in unit tests with more precision.
