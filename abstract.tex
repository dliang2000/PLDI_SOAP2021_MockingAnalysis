\begin{abstract}
	Methods which are not covered by a project's test suite are
	especially prone to exhibiting unexpected behaviours and being more
	challenging to maintain over time. Some methods are untested but
	have related implementations in sibling classes (sharing a common
	superclass) that are tested. Our goal is to help developers improve
	test suites by identifying such untested methods. We have
	implemented a prototype tool, \textsc{SiblingClassTestDetector},
	which accepts programs along with their test suites, and outputs a
	set of Completable Candidates (CCs). We have applied our prototype
	tool to 17 open-source benchmarks and identified 107 CCs within
	these benchmarks. We have also manually produced two tests for
	Completable Candidates and submitted Pull Requests for these
	tests, one of which has been merged by developers.
